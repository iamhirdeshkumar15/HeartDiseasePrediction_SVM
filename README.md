# HeartDiseasePrediction_SVM
This repository contains a predictive analysis project that uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify heart disease. It implements three SVM models (linear, polynomial, and RBF) and evaluates their performance using confusion matrices and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
